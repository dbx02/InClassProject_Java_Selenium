I participated in an automation course where I gained experience with Java and Selenium. 
As part of the course, I developed a project to automate various functionalities on the demoqa.com website. 
The project includes structured test classes that cover a range of web elements, demonstrating my proficiency in test automation and my understanding of web interaction through automation scripts.

During the automation course, I created a project using Java and Selenium focused on automating the interactions with the demoqa.com website. The project is organized into three main files: BaseTest, HelpMethods, and Test classes.

BaseTest: This file serves as the foundational setup for all test cases, handling the initialization of the WebDriver, setting up the test environment, and managing the browser configurations.

HelpMethods: This file includes reusable methods that simplify common tasks, such as element interaction, waiting strategies, and other utility functions that enhance the efficiency of the test scripts.

Test Files: The core of the project, these files contain individual test classes that automate specific interactions on the demoqa.com website. The test classes include:

Alerts: Automates the process of interacting with alert boxes and validating their behavior. 

Buttons: Tests the functionality of various buttons, ensuring they trigger the correct actions.

Checkboxes: Automates the selection and validation of checkboxes on the page. 

Frames & Nested Frames: Handles the automation of frame and nested frame navigation, verifying that elements within frames are correctly accessed.

Links: Automates the verification of link functionality, ensuring that links navigate to the correct destinations.

Radio Buttons: Tests the selection and validation of radio buttons, ensuring they behave as expected.

Text Box: Automates the input and validation of text box fields, ensuring that data entry is processed correctly.

WebTables: Tests the interaction with web tables, including data extraction, sorting, and validation of table contents.
